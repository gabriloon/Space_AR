## BackGround
In implementing Augmented reality, there was something I wanted to check, so I used Vuforia and its own database within Vuforia.<br>
I tested it for the purpose of confirming that the ar function was reproduced by illuminating the specified photo,<br>
and as a result, when I illuminated the photograph of the Earth, a 3D model of the Earth and the moon appeared, and I saw meteorites passing around it as it orbited.<br>
